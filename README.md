# odin-recipes

A recipe website with a few different options to view!
This is my very first website project using HTML and CSS techniques that I learned from The Odin Project, Free Code Camp and Stack overflow of-corse :)!
HTML - structural foundations and basics.
CSS - Basic syntax, selectors, type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, grouping selectors, padding, recolor, etc...

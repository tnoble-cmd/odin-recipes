            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Learn how to make this easy <i>Healthy Baked Chicken Parmesan<i> for a simple and delicious meal that will be on your table in just 30 minutes.<p>
            <p>This is my favorite go-to version of homemade chicken parmesan. It’s healthier than traditional chicken parmesan – especially restaurant versions – but doesn’t sacrifice in the flavor or texture department. Another testament to my theory that healthy food doesn’t have to come in the form of protein meal bars and plain celery sticks.</p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease a large baking pan.</li>
                <li>Brush chicken on both sides with oil, then season with salt and pepper on both sides. Stir together breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese in a shallow dish and toss chicken in the breadcrumb mixture to coat on both sides. Arrange chicken on prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li>Bake chicken for 15-20 minutes until cooked through and no longer pink in the middle. While chicken is cooking, combine marinara sauce, garlic, Italian seasoning, and basil in a medium sauce pan and stir over medium heat until hot throughout.</li>
                <li>When chicken is cooked through, remove from oven and switch oven to broil. Top each chicken breasts with about 1/2 cup of marinara sauce and one slice of mozzarella cheese. Return to oven for 3-4 minutes until cheese is bubbly and starts to brown (keep a close eye on it so it doesn't burn).</li>
                <li>Serve over cooked spaghetti noodles and top with cracked black pepper and fresh basil (optional).</li>
                <li>** For extra crispy breading, spritz the chicken/breading with cooking spray a couple of times throughout baking or bake it on parchment paper and turn over once halfway through baking. </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The chicken: if you only have large, you can cut 2 large breasts in half lengthwise to make four smaller fillets, pounded to even thickness</li>
            </ul>
